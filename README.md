* Click the 'create new app' button on the dashboard. Name your app, select your region and click 'Create App'

* In the "Settings" tab, add both the python and node.js build packs.

* Create a "Config VAR" named 'CREDS' KEY and copy/paste the creds.json file in it.

* Create another "Config VAR" called PORT as the KEY with 8000 as VALUE.

* In the "Deploy" tab, choose GitHub as a deployment method.

* Search for the wanted repository.

* Click on "enable automatic deploys" and then deploy branch.

* once the app built (a minute or two needed)click "View" to access the site.
